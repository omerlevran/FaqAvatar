### How do I know I am in Compliance?<a id="1"></a>
Generally, compliance comes from being within 10% of your target macros and 5% of your target calories.

Read this article for more details: [close-enough]( https://www.avatarnutrition.com/hitting-your-macros-how-close-is-close-enough/)

There are a handful of scorecards that have been created by different members of this group. Some of them are posted in the Files section of the group. Heres one that I use: [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByltVtzYRv9KNks5ZlVSLWl5R0U/view)

### How do I track Alcohol?<a id="2"></a>
Avatar has a great article that can be found [here](https://www.avatarnutrition.com/how-to-track-alcohol/)

Just in case it was **TL:DR** heres the cliffnotes version:
take total calories of your drink and divide by 4 if you want to attribute to carb macros, or divide by 9 if you want to attribute to fat macros (ie: 1 oz of hard liqour = ~65 calories/ 4 (carbs) = 16.25g of carbs) . Since alcohol is not a true macro, it must be attributed to either fats or carbs, in order to be tracked properly.

### Can I convert carbs to fat/other way around?<a id="3"></a>
The general equation for converting is either Multiply Fats by 2.25 to get your carb conversion (ex: 5g of fat * 2.25 = 11.25g carbs) or divide carbs by 2.25 to get your fat conversion (ex:5g of carbs / 2.25 = 2.22g Fats)

### I went over my macros, now what?<a id="4"></a>

You have several options, and this is what makes Avatar Nutrition and flexible dieting so great.
You can choose to:

A) Spread out your overage over the next few days of your week, before you next weigh in.(ie: take your overage and divide by the number of remaining days before weigh in. Take that number and remove that amount of carbs or fats from each remaining day. Track the rest of your day(s) as normal.)

B) Minimize your carb/fat intake on the following day, to make up the difference for the overage (Ie: went over 20g carbs on Monday. Eat 20g carbs less, on Tuesday) ***Scorecards helps with this one!!***

C) if you only went over on either fats or carbs, convert one to the other to make up the difference (see FAQ #7)

D) Track your macros on your scorecard, and just see how the rest of the week plays out. Usually one day of minimal overage, does not put you out of compliance. Check the scorecard!!

### Whats more important, calories or macros?<a id="5"></a>

They are both equally important, but in reality Macros=Calories

If you hit your Macros, then you are hitting your calories! EASY!!

### I tracked my macros on MFP and it says im under my calories...<a id="6"></a>

if you are tracking using Publicly Entered nutrition information, it could be a bit off.

Try to always enter your own nutrition information, to the best of your ability, in order to get the best results.

Also, Labels sometimes round down, so even though your macros may be correct on the label, the calories will not be true, since they have rounded down. Dont worry If the calories are a bit off, Focus on hitting your MAcros!!

### Do I track exercise or cardio in MFP?<a id="7"></a>

NO! Be sure to turn off this setting. If you eat the extra calories/Macros, you will put yourself out of compliance!!! Activity level is already accounted for when you setup your Avatar Nutrition profile, so there is no need to track additional exercise calories.

### My Fitness Pal (MFP) or avatars application?<a id="8"></a>

they are both great ways to track. They each have their pros and cons (and slight learning curves), but either one is a good choice to get started tracking Macros!

### How do I track fiber? When Tracking fiber, do I count only the net carbs?<a id="9"></a>

Avatar Nutrition suggests eating a minimum amount of fiber. Be sure to try and hit that number, daily. When tracking Fiber and carbs, it does not affect total carbs as far as tracking is concerned. Be sure to track all carbs as normal, regardless of what the packaging says.


###  What is reverse dieting?<a id="10"></a>

Reverse Dieting is a form of eating, where more and more calories are added to your weekly intake,in a structured manner, so as to minimize weight gain, while upregulating your metabolism.

READ these articles for more information:

[When is it time to START reverse](https://www.avatarnutrition.com/how-you-know-its-time-to-reverse-diet/)
[When is it time to STOP reverse](https://www.avatarnutrition.com/how-you-know-its-time-to-stop-reverse-dieting/)
[Reverse dieting 101](https://www.avatarnutrition.com/reverse-dieting-101-with-avatar-nutrition/)

###  Can I lose weight while Reverse Dieting?<a id="11"></a>

Most people will lose a little bit of weight while in Reverse Mode, but this is not the goal of a Reverse. The goal is to upregulate your metabolism, allowing you to eat more and more calores/macros, so that you can then perform a successful Maintenance and Cut cycle, where you have MANY more calories/macros to cut from. You could potentially lose weight/fat, while still being able to eat pizza and ice cream!! 


### Do i have to eat tilapia and broccoli to hit my macros, successfully?<a id="12"></a>
NO!! you do not have to stick to only fish and broccoli. using Avatar and Flexible dieting, I can eat literally anything I want, as long as I hit my macro goals for the day (ESPECIALLY FIBER!!)

###  What Diet?<a id="13"></a>
Keto/Paleo/Etc. doesn't matter as long as you are in a caloric deficit

### Should I measure my food cooked or raw?<a id="14"></a>
Food should be measured Raw for the most precise results. However If you have already been using Avatar Nutrition and you have been measuring it cooked, as long as you are seeing results, stick with that method of measuring for consistency purposes.

### How much protein should I eat at one serving?<a id="15"></a>

Read [this](https://www.avatarnutrition.com/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need/)

The myth about "too much protein at one time" has been busted. You probably wont want to eat 100G of protein at once, but be assured that your body will use it. However your stomach may not necessarily agree with you :P
